# Brain-Tumor-Detection

This project aims to detect brain tumors from MRI images using deep learning techniques. In particular, we use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify brain MRI images into four classes.

# Dataset
A Brain tumor is considered as one of the aggressive diseases, among children and adults. Brain tumors account for 85 to 90 percent of all primary Central Nervous System(CNS) tumors. Every year, around 11,700 people are diagnosed with a brain tumor. The 5-year survival rate for people with a cancerous brain or CNS tumor is approximately 34 percent for men and36 percent for women. Brain Tumors are classified as: Benign Tumor, Malignant Tumor, Pituitary Tumor, etc. Proper treatment, planning, and accurate diagnostics should be implemented to improve the life expectancy of the patients. The best technique to detect brain tumors is Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). A huge amount of image data is generated through the scans. These images are examined by the radiologist. A manual examination can be error-prone due to the level of complexities involved in brain tumors and their properties.
Application of automated classification techniques using Machine Learning(ML) and Artificial Intelligence(AI)has consistently shown higher accuracy than manual classification. Hence, proposing a system performing detection and classification by using Deep Learning Algorithms using ConvolutionNeural Network (CNN), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and TransferLearning (TL) would be helpful to doctors all around the world.

# About Project

As part of this project, I collaborated with a team of medical professionals and software engineers to develop a machine learning model that could accurately detect brain tumors in medical imaging data. Our goal was to improve the accuracy and efficiency of brain tumor detection, which is crucial for early diagnosis and effective treatment.
<br>

We started by gathering a large dataset of brain images and labeling them according to whether or not they contained tumors. Using this dataset, we trained and tested several machine learning models, experimenting with different algorithms, hyperparameters, and feature engineering techniques.

Through this process, we were able to achieve a high level of accuracy in detecting brain tumors, with an AUC score of over 0.96. We also developed a user-friendly web application that allowed medical professionals to upload and analyze brain images in real-time.
<br>

Overall, this project was a fantastic learning experience for me, as it required a combination of technical skills and domain knowledge. I gained a deeper understanding of medical imaging and the challenges associated with detecting brain tumors, as well as valuable experience in machine learning model development and deployment.
<br>

I'm grateful for the opportunity to have worked on this project and to have contributed to improving the detection and treatment of brain tumors.
